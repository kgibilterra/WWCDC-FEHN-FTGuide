## WWCDC Front End Hack night first timer's guide

### What is Front End

When someone says “frontend” of the web, what they really mean is the part of the website or web application that a person can visually see and interact with. As the name states “Front-End” is the part of the code that is on the front of the application. The main purpose of the front-end code is to interact with user, as well as present the data in a well-defined style, and structure. It usually consists of two parts: 

* the design - aesthetics of the website or application, understanding element arrangements on the screen, the color and font choices

* front end web development or client-side development- development of those elements of a website that the customer sees and interacts with directly. This piece involves programming skills, comprising mainly of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** but certainly not limited to them.

### Front End Development

The focus of this study group is **Front End Development**, we appreciate and encourage designers to join and share their wisdom, but the purpose of the group is to encourage every one to code. 

A front end developer is the bridge connecting the designer and back end developer. The developer’s work is to take the final designs of an application from the designer, and code it into the front-end code so the back-end developer can understand it and build functionality of that app around it. 

Almost all the elements that you see, and interact on any website is a mixture of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are all controlled by the browser. For example, if you’re using Google Chrome or Firefox or Safari, the browser is what translates all of the code in a manner for you to see and with which to interact, such as fonts, colors, drop-down menus, images, forms, etc.
